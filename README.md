# Car Prices Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes the "Car Prices" dataset to predict vehicle prices using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to explore different models and evaluate their performance in estimating car prices based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from RPubs and can be found at the following link:  
[Car Prices Dataset](https://rpubs.com/Hyreen/1177503)

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Model Training:** Implementing multiple regression models, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing the performance of different models using evaluation metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².
- **Power BI Report:** A Power BI dashboard is included for interactive data visualization and insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use
1. Install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code cells to see the results.
3. Install Power BI and open the `.pbix` file to view the report.
